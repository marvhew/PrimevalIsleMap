# PrimevalIsleMap

Map of Primeval Isle for Honkai Impact 3rd's A Feast Sought in Data Event.

There are two files, png and xcf. Png is a standard image with a map of Primeval Isle with counted ingredients. Xcf is a gimp project of that map with each ingredient in a separate layer, so you can filter the map by switching the visibility of these layers.
